# Wiki Archives

This guide was created to capture a lot of the information from the now defunct Unreal Engine 4 wiki. Epic made the poor decision to remove the Wiki entirely without first providing alternative sources to the information that was provided by the community. This guide hopes to capture the now lost information and make it available to the developers who have come to rely on it and potentially even provide a platform for new content to be published.

## So the community Wiki is gone, now what?

It would be shocking if Epic didn't wind up putting the Wiki back only, at least for a temporary amount of time. But in the event that they don't \(or if it takes them a while to do so\), we can do our best to retain and archive as much of the wiki on this site.

### I can't find the article I'm looking for...

We've gone ahead and scoured the Wayback Machine in order to a create a `.zip` file with as much archival data as we could retrieve. This file is available for download on Dropbox using the following link:

{% embed url="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g7plgzei399v342/wiki.unrealengine.com.zip?dl=0" %}

If you can't find it in the `.zip` archive, changes are that it's lost for good until Epic or the original author reposts it somewhere else.

## I want to contribute, how can I help?

1. [Fork the repository for this site on Github](https://github.com/NickGlenn/Unreal-Engine-4-Community-Guide).
2. Figure out which articles you'd like to add to the book and make sure they don't already exist.
3. Use archive resource\(s\) above to find the article contents.
4. Format the article using markdown. Ideally add syntax highlighting to code examples to help improve readability. **Be sure to include credits the original author\(s\) of the article.**
5. Create a Pull Request in Github for the article.
