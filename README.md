# Introduction

This guide was created to capture a lot of the information from the now defunct Unreal Engine 4 wiki. Epic made the poor decision to remove the Wiki entirely without first providing alternative sources to the information that was provided by the community. This guide hopes to capture the now lost information and make it available to the developers who have come to rely on it and potentially even provide a platform for new content to be published.

## How can I help?

We can use all the help we can get! This book is powered by Github and changes can be tracked on the repository.

### I want to help archive an existing wiki article

1. [Fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ss_V-bzfXg0Fkjl6lfFgPyLmdRUsNmXUqdzC1rYSLjY) with your email and Github username.
2. Once you've been added to the repository as a contributor, figure out which articles you'd like to add to the book.
3. Using the WaybackMachine Internet Archive, we can find snapshots of the wiki to get the original content of the article.
4. Format the article using markdown or through the Gitbook editor. Ideally add syntax highlighting to code examples to help improve readability.
5. Be sure to include credits the original author\(s\) of the article.

### I want to write a new article

We'll figure out a process for this and capture the requirements soon.
